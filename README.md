# PySpinor
A python library for spinor calculations.

# Uses
This can be used for numerical computations of spinor calculations, for example, in calculating simple QED and QCD matrix element calculations.

# Aims
Aims include:
  1. Adding support for symbolic calculations,
  2. Supporting generation of matrix elements from diagrams via interfacing with MadGraph v5,
  3. Adding automated colour factor computations
  4. Adding a simple phase space generator for random phase space point evaluation of matrix elements
